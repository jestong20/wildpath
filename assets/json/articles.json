		"author":"Dr. Hayley Stainton",
		"content":"<p>Wildlife tourism can be a great thing. There are many positive impacts of wildlife tourism including; conservation, research, breeding programmes and economic benefits.</p><b>Conservation</b><p>For many wildlife tourism businesses, conservation is their top priority. In fact, most places where the focus is conservation would rather not have any tourists come to visit at all, however it is the tourists that pay the bills and allow their business to operate. </p><b>Research</b><p>Wildlife tourism also facilitates important research. Research can help us to further understand the animals and therefore to better cater for them, both in the wild and in captivity.</p><b>Breeding programmes</b><p>Many wildlife tourism projects have successful breeding programmes. From Siberian tigers and pandas in China to koalas in Australia to lions in Botswana, there are successful breeding programmes underway around the world. Many of these programmes would not be able to operate without the money raised from tourists.</p><b>Economic benefits</b><p>There are many positive economic impacts of wildlife tourism.Wildlife tourism brings tourists to a given area, and they bring money with them! They spend money on hotels, on food and on transport.</p><b>Job creation</b><p>Another economic advantage of wildlife tourism that is worth mentioning is job creation. Whatever type of wildlife business it is, it will require staff. This helps to boost employment figures in the area as well as helping the boost the overall economic prospects resulting from wildlife tourism. </p>",

		"content":"<p>So, what degree do you need to be a wildlife conservationist? For any kind of conservation scientists tasked with protecting wildlife, a bachelor’s degree is usually required for entry-level positions. After high school, a wildlife career path can begin with a degree in many different fields relating to wildlife science. Aspiring conservationists may enroll in an undergraduate program for wildlife biology, natural resources, or agriculture science. Seeking an advanced position? You most likely need a master’s degree.</p><p>Some of the top degrees a wildlife conservationist may consider might include:</p><ul><li> Marine Biology and Sustainable Aquaculture </li><li>Wildlife & Fisheries Biology</li><li>Environmental Science</li></ul><p>There are many careers related to wildlife conservation and plenty of options to choose from when it’s time to transition. As forest fires become an increasing problem, foresters are needed to advise safe and sustainable prevention methods. Environmental engineers also share a similar background, focusing specifically on developing solutions to environmental dilemmas. While the industry is typically very competitive, there are specialties available for wildlife policy analysts, consultants, and economists. </p>",

The rules tend to be stricter regarding the harvesting of fish, game, or other natural resources. Access for recreational purposes may be restricted and some types of transportation may be prohibited, such as motorized vehicles or boats. Individual refuges may be focused primarily on protecting a single species or tiny ecosystem, rather than dealing with the larger, surrounding ecosystem that state agencies are concerned with.</p><p>That preservation may involve deeper management of the ecology than would be expected of state wardens. Wildlife Officers are often concerned with wildfire protection and response. Because of their intimate familiarity with the flora and fauna in their territory, they also more often serve as interpreters for visitors.</p>",

		"content":"<p>Varun Dutta Gupta, our next pathbreaker, Wildlife GIS Analyst, works on multiple projects for wildlife conservation through geospatial analysis and by creation of GIS databases for effective tracking.</p><p>The biggest challenge is that there is a lack of knowledge for the field of GIS in India, its applications and importance in day to day life. In other developed countries, everything has to be geospatially linked. Many countries have a vast and ever expanding openly sourced data available for public use but in India a lot of data is kept under wraps. The data availability especially with regard to wildlife is exceptionally low. </p><p>The best way to address the scarcity/dearth of data is to create your own datasets. Field data is always the best. You know that it has been attained by you and you know its authenticity as well as its applicability and hence you should always have a field visit to personally verify the datasets or collect data. </p><p>Currently I work with one of the biggest wildlife conservation NGOs in the world – WWF India as an Information Officer/GIS Analyst. I work in the ENVIS (Funded by MoEF&CC) and IGCMC Division of WWF India. The division is headed by Dr. G. Areendran (Director IGCMC & Coordinator ENVIS) under the direct supervision of Mr. Ravi Singh (SG & CEO WWF India) and Dr. Sejal Worah (Programme Director).The division has been pioneering the GIS based conservation activities from 1994. It supports biodiversity and natural resource conservation in India through the collection, management, and accessibility of relevant data and knowledge. For this purpose, IGCMC uses GIS and remote sensing techniques to procure data to facilitate WWF-India’s work as well as other partner agencies  in the field of conservation. </p><p>I work on multiple projects for wildlife conservation. I have also been mentoring Green Skill Development Programme (GSDP) students who have taken Wildlife Management using geospatial techniques and another course on bird identification and basic ornithology as well as Masters and summer interns in my Division. Till date I have mentored and trained over 150 students. I specialize in writing proposals as well as project management. </p>",

Having so many memories with them, it influenced Jonny to be more than just a 'helping hand'; it became a motivational drive for him to go official by pursuing conservationism. </p><p>After completing the first year of his Bachelor of Science at the Royal Institute of Colombo located in Sri Lanka, he accepted the chance to finish the rest of his degree at the Deakins University in Australia, to continue the rest of his years there. As expected, he learned a lot of things along the way. He even had his successes in trapping and handling animals as part of his degree using different techniques that he have learned. </p><p>Jonny, as a second year student taking a 3-year degree, already had two internships lined up for him at that time and had plans to take a Master's degree, then a PhD, until he works especially with preserving big cats. He longly desires to help the willdlife and ecosystems in both Africa and the Amazon River. </p><p>In the modern day, year of 2021, it has been years since he posted his blog (which was published around 2015). Back then, he was still a student holding a degree. Now, he's a former master of conservation biology at University of Queensland.

He added that these are all donated and brought into the laboratory by various groups, such as zoos and museums, from around the world. </p><p>In every investigation that Johnnie has handled, he always begin with questions in mind, 'What is this species? How did it die?', and follows up more questions as he answers them along the way. The laboratory may still have some unsolved cases but they're still giving their best to reveal more information from them, for their jobs are not as easy as they seem. </p><p>Despite that and some other struggles he faced, Johnnie still loves his job.

		"content":"<p>The primary role of being a wildlife manager means you must manage their lives of being in the wild in order to keep them going. An example is making sure that the size of a habitat's population is in a stable number. Not too many that will overpopulate their species and not too few to prevent causing their extinction. </p><p>From fieldwork to research and analysis, evaluating wild species and their habitats is also a part of your job, which means that you have to work mainly outdoors. You also have to be fit enough to deal with strenous activities, in case you're in for a chase to catch an animal just to get samples of data. </p><p>Having knowledge about the laws concerning wildlife in which you work is considerably counted. You may expect your job to be flexible for there are other job aspects that may also be applied to it, such as being a law enforcer, an adviser, or a public relations officer.</p><p>Of course, being careful is another thing that you have to consider, especially that there are possibilities that you may end up either in a dangerous situation or the wild seeing you as a danger to them. Out of all the things that you need to know about having this job, the one that matters the most, however, is the love that you have for the environment.</p>",
